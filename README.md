# Reaction

## Introduction ##
A 2D Platformer game where the player must solve puzzles and move cleverly using their various guns and their different recoil.

## Features ##
Reaction is all about using Newton's Third Law to the player's advantage, such that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. There are currently 21 levels with varying game mechanics and puzzles to explore! Across these 25 levels, players will find the ability to use 2 different guns, swap between the 2, and use their recoils to reach the end.
